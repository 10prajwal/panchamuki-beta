                    <p class="text-justify p-0">Rama, one of the most widely worshiped All deities, the embodiment of
                        CHIVALRY and virtue. Although there are three Ramas mentioned in Indian tradition PARASHURAMA,
                        BALARAMA, and Ramachandraâ€”the name is specifically associated with Ramachandra, the seventh
                        incarnation AVATAR of VISHNU. Rama and KRISHNA (also an incarnation of Vishnu) were the two
                        most-popular recipients of adoration from the BHAKTI (devotional) groups
                        that swept the country during that time. Whereas Krishna is adored for his mischievous pranks
                        and amorous dalliances, Rama is conceived as a model of reason, right action, and desirable
                        virtues. Temples to Rama faced by shrines to his devotee HANUMAN are widespread throughout
                        INDIA. In Siddapura we are builting a 50 feet Rama statue. </p>

                        magnificent one in many forms. One of the much-revered forms is the poWerful Panchmukhi Hanuman.
                        Five faces staring in different directions, in Siddapura we are builting a 10 feet panchamuki
                        anjaneaiaha statue. Lord Hanuman: He faces eastwards with steadfast devotion. Worshipping
                        Hanuman
                        helps one to get rid of one's sins and bestows peace, purity, happiness, and fulfillment.
                        Lord Narasimha: One of the many avatars of Lord Vishnu, this lion form is south
                        facing. Lord Vishnu took this form to protect his devotee, Prahlada. Worshipping
                        Narasimha removes fear. Fearlessness and victory are the blessings showered on the
                        devotee.
                        Lord Garuda: Facing west, the Garuda or eagle is part of the Panchmukhi Hanuman
                        manifestation. He offers protection from negative influences, black magic, and evil
                        spirits.
                        Lord Adivaraha: The boar is another manifestation and is believed to remove the bad
                        effects of planetary movements. Facing the north, Varaha bestows wealth and prosperity.
                        Lord Hayagriva: The form of the horse faces upward, blessing one with knowledge,
                        progeny and liberation.
